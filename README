serial console automation : 
connect direct to any consol by name using a single tab-extendable command

copy rules.d/* host:/etc/udev/rules.d
copy bin/*     host:/usr/local/bin
make sure there's a working copy of kermit on the host machine.
for a user to be able to USE the console, must be a member of groups
dialout
lockers

How it works:

plug in a usb console ..
1 udev picks it up and makes a match from /etc/udev/rules.d
2 then it runs the script make-tty-symlink

example

Plug in console for acq1001_030

1: makes the link:
/dev/tty_acq1001_030 -> ttyUSB1

... this is the real value of this system, auto-tracks changing ttyUSBx

2: makes the link:
/usr/local/bin/tty_acq1001_030 -> kermit-ttySx-115200

Now simply type tty_acq1001_030 to connect direct to the console wiith one command.

Making it really smooth:
- check you have the correct group membership to use the console
- make a file ~/.kermrc:
cat ~/.kermrc
SET CARRIER-WATCH OFF

Updates:
- make a working directory copy of this git archive in a user directory
(I wasn't brave enough to do this direct from /etc)
- please update /etc/rules.d/90-acq* as we add more uuts
- test, copy back to your user, check in and git-push
